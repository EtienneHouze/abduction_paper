# What should I notice? Using Alogithmic Information Theory to evaluate the memorability of events in smart homes

This manuscript considers the issue of defining a measure of memorability for heterogeneous events, e.g. events detected in complex cyber-physical systems such as smart homes. While identifying some events as more memorable than others is a common ability for humans, this notion has not currently been investigated in computer science, to the best of our knowledge. The authors of this paper introduce a formal definition of memorabilty based on Algorithmic Information Theory and previous results of Simplicity Theory.

This research fits within the scope of Entropy Journal as it relies on the notions of Kolmogorov Complexity to tackle an existing challenge in current applied complex system. The main contribution is the defintion of memorability and an algorithm to compute it. It also contains implementation examples to apply the theoreticla concepts in simple but realising situations.

All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to Entropy. We confirm that neither the manuscript nor any parts of its content are currently under consideration or published in another journal.
